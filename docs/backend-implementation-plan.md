# Backend Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the practical steps to build out the serverless backend.
See [backend-design.md](./backend-design.md) for the overall architecture.

1. **Set up DynamoDB table and environment configuration.**
   - Create the single-table layout described in the design document.
   - Configure table name and AWS region via environment variables for Lambda.

2. **Implement CRUD Lambda functions for workspaces and notes.**
   - Provide create, read, update and delete handlers.
   - Use the shared models and persist data in DynamoDB.

3. **Add membership checks for shared workspaces.**
   - Ensure only owners and contributors can modify a workspace or its notes.
   - Deny unauthorized actions with appropriate HTTP status codes.

4. **Introduce WebSocket connection handling for broadcasting changes.**
   - Use API Gateway or AppSync to manage connections.
   - Publish workspace and note events to connected clients.

5. **Update front-end service (`AppService`) to call the API and subscribe for updates.**
   - Replace placeholder methods with real API calls.
   - Subscribe to WebSocket events to keep the UI in sync.

6. **Provide a testing strategy for new handlers.**
   - Add unit tests for each Lambda function using the existing test framework.
   - Include integration tests for WebSocket broadcasting.
